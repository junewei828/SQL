SQL stores data in tables. NoSQL stores data in forms other than tables; 
these forms can be graphs, key-value pairs, or one of many other options, 
but most commonly they are documents. These documents are very similar to JSON 
objects with field-value pairs. For example, our NoSQL database might store a user 
like this:

{
  username: "mongoDB4ever",
  email: "alexa@gmail.com",
  password_digest: "Ke&63h1z$mK9jd37n"
}

So instead of rows, NoSQL has documents. These documents can be stored in collections, 
which are similar to SQL's tables in that they hold and organize related entries in the 
database. Beyond that, however, they are quite different. Unlike tables, collections do 
not have schema. They are not restricted to particular columns/fields. They do not require 
specific data types, like strings, integers, or dates. They are much more flexible. This 
means that the design does not have to be specified upfront.
